## Introduction

Nobody asked for a copy of Vim that runs with the JVM, but here we are. A Clojure library that wraps [libvim](https://github.com/onivim/libvim) (specifically [this fork](https://github.com/oakes/libvim)). It includes prebuilt binaries for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux (x64 only) which it talks to via JNI. See [the generated docs](https://oakes.github.io/libvim-clj) and enjoy your nightmares.
